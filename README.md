## PROJECT OVERVIEW
I was giving a dataset extracted from a car sharing comapany's operations in less than 2 years.
To sharpen my skills in SQL querying and database management, i'm required to create a database management system for the car sharing company and perform business intelligence.
This journey will take me through the route of DATA CLEANING & TRANSFORMATION, TABLES CREATION, DATABASE CREATION and SQL QUERYING and PRESENTATION.
