# CarSharing-Report-With-SQL-Queris
This is part of my SQL course work with [Datafied Academy](https://github.com/Datafyde).


## PROJECT OVERVIEW
I was giving a dataset extracted from a car sharing comapany's operations in less than 2 years.
To sharpen my skills in SQL querying and database management, i'm required to create a database management system
for the car sharing company and perform business intelligence.

This journey will take me through the route of **DATA CLEANING** & **TRANSFORMATION**, **TABLES CREATION**, **DATABASE CREATION**, **SQL QUERYING** and **PRESENTATION**.

## DATA INFORMATION
The dataset contains information about the customers’ demand rate between January 2017 and August 2018. The data were collected on an hourly basis and included the time data such as date, hour, and season as well as weather data such as the weather condition, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The ‘demand’ column represents the customer’s willingness for renting a car for a specific time. Higher demand rates show that customers are more willing to rent a car and vice versa.
