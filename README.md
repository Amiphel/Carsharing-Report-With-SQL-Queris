# CarSharing-Report-With-SQL-Queris
This is part of my SQL course work with [Datafied Academy](https://github.com/Datafyde).


## PROJECT OVERVIEW
I was giving a dataset extracted from a car sharing comapany's operations in less than 2 years.
To sharpen my skills in SQL querying and database management, i'm required to create a database management system
for the car sharing company and perform business intelligence.

This journey will take me through the route of **DATA CLEANING** & **TRANSFORMATION**, **TABLES CREATION**, **DATABASE CREATION**, **SQL QUERYING** and **PRESENTATION**.

## DATA INFORMATION
The dataset contains information about the customersâ€™ demand rate between January 2017 and August 2018. The data were collected on an hourly basis and included the time data such as date, hour, and season as well as weather data such as the weather condition, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The â€˜demandâ€™ column represents the customerâ€™s willingness for renting a car for a specific time. Higher demand rates show that customers are more willing to rent a car and vice versa.

## FILES

**Data set**: contains the extracted data as CarSharing Raw dataset.csv.
This was broken into 1 fact table and 3 dimension tables.

fact table - carsharing.csv

Dimension 1 - temperature.csv

Dimension 2 - ttime.csv

Dimension 3 - weather.csv

**ER Diagram**: Entity relationship diagram showing the data model and the relationships between tables

**Data dictionary**: explaning the data set

## SQL QUERIES
1. Highest demand rate in 2017 - Date and Time.

2. Highest and lowest average demand throughout 2017, showing weekday, month, and season as well as the calculated average demand values.

3. With reference to no. 2, what is the average demand at different hours of that weekday throughout 2017 in descending order based on the average demand.

4. What was the most prevalent weather condition in 2017? What was the average, highest, and lowest wind speed and humidity for each month in 2017?  organized in two tables for the wind speed and humidity. show the average demand for each cold, mild, and hot weather in 2017 sorted in descending order based on their average demand.

5.  Draw another table showing the information requested in (4) for the month with the highest average demand in 2017 for comparative purposes with other months.
